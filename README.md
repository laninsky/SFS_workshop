# SFS_workshop
Using `CubSFS` to get demographic reconstructions of a population using an SFS (allele/site frequency spectrum)

## Objectives
By the end of today hopefully you will:
1. Be able to install `R Studio` and manually install an R package
2. Know how to source `R` functions within R Studio
3. Read in an SFS file into `R`
4. Run a `CubSFS` analysis
5. Evaluate whether results are valid based on knot placement, bootstrap, and QC metrics.
6. Plot the data
