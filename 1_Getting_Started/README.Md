## 1. Getting Started
Welcome to our workshop on using CubSFS to generate a demographic reconstruction based on a SFS (allele/site frequency spectrum). Alana will give you a brief spiel about what a SFS is and a general description of how this analysis works in just a sec, but first, let's download the programs/files we need, so the installation can proceed while she's prattling on.  

### A) Downloading R studio
First off, we need to download R Studio (if it isn't already on your computer) - head to: `https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/`  
Download the RStudio Desktop Open Source License version that matches your operating system (note, can be quite a big download e.g. 150MB!)
